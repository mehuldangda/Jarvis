# JARVIS: AI Virtual Assistant (Python)

JARVIS is a Python-based desktop voice assistant capable of performing various tasks like opening applications, fetching news, sending emails, answering queries, and more. This project helped me explore speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, and Python automation modules.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- Voice command-based interactions
- Opens common desktop apps and websites
- Sends emails through SMTP
- Fetches real-time news headlines
- Tells time, jokes, and answers queries using WolframAlpha
- Wikipedia search functionality

## ðŸ§  Tech Stack
- Python
- `speech_recognition`
- `pyttsx3` (text-to-speech)
- `wikipedia`, `smtplib`, `webbrowser`, etc.

## ðŸš€ What I Learned
- Voice input/output handling in Python
- Working with APIs like WolframAlpha and NewsAPI
- Automating desktop workflows
- Structuring modular Python code

## ðŸ¤– Inspired by
This project was built while learning from CodeWithHarryâ€™s Python tutorials and then extended with personalized tweaks and additional functionality.
